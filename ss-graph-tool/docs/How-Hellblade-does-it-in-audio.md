This is more on the design side. The inner voice and mental state stuff begins from about 00:41:28. They mentioned according to expert consultants, the voices are ”all around in 3d, sometimes are in very specific positions (around the mental state carrier in their imaginary space), sometimes distorted, sometimes in different languages”.

There is a clip as reference from 00:46:30. It is also a demonstration of the intended-to-be-conveyed feeling of “the thing that hurts the most for her (a consultant) is in a beautiful state of mind… then it kind of gets pull from under your feet… when you are not prepared for what’s coming”.

So generally I think the project owner referred to Hellblade in the hope that this technique can be used to create “stream of consciousness” narrative effect for the schizophrenia-carrying protagonist of his game.

They mentioned

It is interesting psychological concept to deliver to the player, but I don’t think this specific presentation would work well in a stealth action game. But the idea is interesting.
